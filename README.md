Welcome to my **C++ Projects Repository**!  
This repository contains a curated collection of **C++ console-based projects**, designed to **strengthen problem-solving skills**, implement **core programming concepts**, and apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in real-world scenarios.

Each project folder contains **two supporting files** (like README.md or data files) and **one main C++ source file (`.cpp`)**.  
Projects are organized from **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced** levels to demonstrate gradual learning and skill progression.
